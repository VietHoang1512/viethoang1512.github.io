My name is Hoang Phan, I am a Ph.D. student at New York University Center for Data Science, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Qi Lei](https://cecilialeiqi.github.io/) and Professor [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/). Before joining NYU, I was a Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/), Machine Learning group, working under the supervision of Professor [Trung Le](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trung-le).

In 2022, I graduated from the honors program at [School of Information and Communication Technology (SoICT)](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/),  [Hanoi University of Science & Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.vn/) with a Computer Science Bachelor's degree. During my time here, I was a research student at [Data Science Laboratory](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/), advised by [Dr. Linh Ngo](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/) and Professor [Khoat Than](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z2_6ZRYAAAAJ&hl).
